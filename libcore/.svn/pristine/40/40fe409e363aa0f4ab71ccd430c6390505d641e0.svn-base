<p>This package provides all the classes and interfaces that
constitute the Java security framework. The content of this package can
be divided into two parts:

<ul>
	<li>Classes implementing the access control infrastructure.
	<p>The central class is <i>java.security.AccessController</i>
	which checks if code, invoking sensitive resources, was granted the required
	permissions.
	<p>The class loader (<i>java.security.SecureClassLoader</i>) associates classes
	with a protection domain (<i>java.security.ProtectionDomain</i>) which consists of a
	code source (<i>java.security.CodeSource</i>) and the granted permissions 
	(<i>java.security.Permission</i>). The policy, defined through <i>java.security.Policy</i>, defines
	which permissions are granted to classes loaded from a code source ( class
	<i>java.security.CodeSource</i>).
	<li>Classes and interfaces for the extensible cryptographic
	<i>service provider infrastructure</i> (<b>SPI</b>) such as abstractions for certificates,
	signatures, private and public keys. Also abstractions for the algorithms
	they utilize are provided in this package.
	<p>Security providers, as defined in <i>java.security.Providers</i>, can be 
	registered to provide
	different implementations for a variety of security infrastructure,
	such as key stores. Therefore the corresponding
	service provider interface (i.e. <i>java.security.KeyStoreSpi</i>) must be
	implemented.
</ul>

This package provides the classes and interfaces needed to implement and program
different methods of users' authentication and role based users' authorization.

All subjects' authentication and role based authorization are strongly coupled with
the java.security file that, as always, is the ultimate arbiter of all matters secure in Android.
For example the class <i>javax.security.auth.SubjectDomainCombiner</i> updates the
ProtectionDomains associated with the actual class with the subjects defined therein.

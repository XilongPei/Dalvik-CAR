This package provides the classes and interfaces for cryptographic applications implementing algorithms for encryption, decryption, or
key agreement. 
</p><p>
Stream ciphers are supported as well as asymmetric, symmetric and block ciphers. Cipher implementations from different providers can be integrated using
the SPI (Service Provider Interface) abstract classes. With class {@link javax.crypto.SealedObject} a programmer can secure an object by
encrypting it with a cipher.
</p><p>
Authentication may be based on MAC (Message Authentication Code) such as HMAC (Hash MAC, i.e. with a SHA-1 hash function).

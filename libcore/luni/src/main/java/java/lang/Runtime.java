     * Registers a virtual-machine shutdown hook. A shutdown hook is a
     * {@code Thread} that is ready to run, but has not yet been started. All
     * registered shutdown hooks will be executed once the virtual machine shuts
     * down properly. A proper shutdown happens when either the
     * {@link #exit(int)} method is called or the surrounding system decides to
     * terminate the application, for example in response to a {@code CTRL-C} or
     * a system-wide shutdown. A termination of the virtual machine due to the
     * {@link #halt(int)} method, an {@link Error} or a {@code SIGKILL}, in
     * contrast, is not considered a proper shutdown. In these cases the
     * shutdown hooks will not be run.
     * <p>
     * Shutdown hooks are run concurrently and in an unspecified order. Hooks
     * failing due to an unhandled exception are not a problem, but the stack
     * trace might be printed to the console. Once initiated, the whole shutdown
     * process can only be terminated by calling {@code halt()}.
     * <p>
     * If {@link #runFinalizersOnExit(boolean)} has been called with a {@code
     * true} argument, garbage collection and finalization will take place after
     * all hooks are either finished or have failed. Then the virtual machine
     * terminates.
     * <p>
     * It is recommended that shutdown hooks do not do any time-consuming
     * activities, in order to not hold up the shutdown process longer than
     * necessary.

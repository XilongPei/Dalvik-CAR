/**
 * A {@code Thread} is a concurrent unit of execution. It has its own call stack
 * for methods being invoked, their arguments and local variables. Each virtual
 * machine instance has at least one main {@code Thread} running when it is
 * started; typically, there are several others for housekeeping. The
 * application might decide to launch additional {@code Thread}s for specific
 * purposes.
 * <p>
 * {@code Thread}s in the same VM interact and synchronize by the use of shared
 * objects and monitors associated with these objects. Synchronized methods and
 * part of the API in {@link Object} also allow {@code Thread}s to cooperate.
 * <p>
 * There are basically two main ways of having a {@code Thread} execute
 * application code. One is providing a new class that extends {@code Thread}
 * and overriding its {@link #run()} method. The other is providing a new
 * {@code Thread} instance with a {@link Runnable} object during its creation.
 * In both cases, the {@link #start()} method must be called to actually execute
 * the new {@code Thread}.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code Thread} has an integer priority that basically determines the
 * amount of CPU time the {@code Thread} gets. It can be set using the
 * {@link #setPriority(int)} method. A {@code Thread} can also be made a daemon,
 * which makes it run in the background. The latter also affects VM termination
 * behavior: the VM does not terminate automatically as long as there are
 * non-daemon threads running.
